If you click on the Run button on the right corner, Run all the above chuncks function is very useful, there is the same button on each chunk of the rmark down chunks.

In R you can work with matrices, vectors, tibble, stibble, .... , to do so you will need to assign your values to a vector for example. 
c<- c(3, 4) just like this 
Then, you can work on c or you can assign new values to c and therefore erase the old c 
c<-c(5,6)
c will return you [5, 6]

In R you can always work without assigning any values on any vectors,.., however you will not be able to use it aferwards. This will useful to for example try a code without modifying the old c. 

In R in you do not need to use the print() function to see a matrices, vectors, tibble, stibble, .... , only calling it by its name is enough. Running print(a) = a

What is super useful it that you can select with you mouse a part of the code and only run it.

If you're working in the console (you're trying new codes), use the arrows(vers le haut) to get the previous code you've just done..

At any moment, if you are not sure how to use a function you can run this for example: ?if and then it will show you its help sheet in the help. Of course google is your best friend if anything is missing. 

When you are writting a function and you do not remember the arguments in it you can use tab to see them.
